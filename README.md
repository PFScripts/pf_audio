## `Information`

* **FiveM:** Works out of the box.
* **RedM:** WIP (I have no time to test this on RedM atm, but I'm aware that the natives are quite similar but there are more of them, I never checked them out, anyways it should not be too painful to adapt it to RedM).
* **Stop/Pause:** Stop or Pause an audio thats already playing its not supported.
* **Loop:** Looping an audio is not supported.

## `FAQ` 

### `Is this built from scratch?`

Nah I just went through Manason code and adapt it for my own needs and likings, also I wanted to expand this to RedM soo yea, Ill leave the repo of his audio api bellow.

### `How can I add new audio?` 

  **1.** If you never worked with native audio before i advice you to check this FiveM Forum Thread.

  - [**[How-to] Make a SimpleSound using native audio**](https://forum.cfx.re/t/how-to-make-a-simplesound-using-native-audio/5156001)

  **2.** You'll need a tool like the one below or just make everything on your own from scratch ðŸ¤“.

  - [**native-audio-tool**](https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/native-audio-tool)

  **3.** After you're done with you're files, create a new folder in audios folder with you're native audio content. The scructure of the audios folder should be as bellow.

  ```
  /audios
    /newAudioFolder1
      /audiodirectory
      /data
    /newAudioFolder2
      /audiodirectory
      /data
    /newAudioFolder3
      /audiodirectory
      /data
  ```
